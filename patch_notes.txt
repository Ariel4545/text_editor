emoji bug fix - fixed most (up to all) of the things that caused the cursor to move to unwanted positions after emoji detection

Text twisters:
text twisters update: work with highlight as well.

Record & (menu) Modes:
record - the big events of the app since the opening will be added to a list that can be accessed in a text box in a new menu
modes - a simple solution to not make the program overloaded with too much stuff:
dev mode - the dev mode controls the Record cascade
special tools - controls the tools cascade and colors+ cascade

Others:
extended help content.
made that the bold font on the tool menu will be instead of the AI tools on the most original & good ones! - also
made the font size smaller, to match the other sizes of the menus.
fixed some names
fixed: colors+ -> app colors -> frame colors bug -  the right of the bottom of the program wasn't changing color
fixed & improved: fixed content's stats bug that a newline word was connected to the last word before her,
and with that knowledge I also make that word split is based on some symbols and not just whitespace
fixed: "sort by characters" whitespaces and newline bug
fixed: "reverse characters" newline being at the first index
made some of the repetitive things consistent - tools' titles & fonts etc.
