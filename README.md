## Personal goal 🌟
My goal with this project is to learn the Python eco-system and tkinter while having fun  
and to take tkinter to its limits by implementing many unique things within the process of building this long project.  
In addition, after I shared this project I also wanted to create a good GitHub repository by making it organized and presenting the project well.
